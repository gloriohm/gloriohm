*Theoretical advancements have been made available to the paying public.*

No answer will appear at the end of theory. It is possible something will appear at the end of pragmatism, but to call it an answer is misleading. At best the praxis *is* the answer, although it's not the embodiment of the answer as much as it is what brings about the answer; nor will the answer make sense when it's brought forth, because the problem that was solved for have been made radically other. The seeking of answers can be productive, but is fundamentally misguided, because the problem is the begetter enabling any movement at all.

Secreting the secrets, never hidden as much as contained, kept veiled by blockages rather than desire to hide, masochistic patterns fueled by self-loathing installed from an upbringing imprinting the subject only with the understanding that there is nothing worse than being *wrong*.

Making moves towards an understanding of the self as a machine that never properly functioned, slight nudges in the direction of the edge of the precipice, intuitively understanding that the fall won't kill it but certain that it will hurt, kickstarting by complete disassembly, shedding the layers of complexion added and altered throughout the years, just to get to the truth -- the truth that *it doesn't have to be like this* and that I have the power to change it (although merely through self-destruction -- not to be confused with self-loathing --). Jumping is almost impossible, there is too much invested by the Ego to let itself be dismantled so easily. (Unlike the self, the Ego is never dissatisfied with its modus operandi; all it cares about is homeostasis.) The most effective approach (lest one do something desperate) is therefore to edge slowly forwards -- if you cannot manage to walk one step, crawl a centimeter -- and the progress will compound to create a situation that is more manageable than the preceding one, allowing the following steps to be greater.

It is the hopelessness of the self that it constantly imagines a radical otherness but is (naturally) untrained when it comes to achieving it. To dream but not have the practical wits to follow them -- that is the wish of the gluttonous self: to reap the reward but outsource the work.
