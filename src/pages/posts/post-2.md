It feels like something's missing; a gap previously inhabited by a memory.

Influences come criss-crossing from spaces untraversed except during those moments of melding in which the messages mostly appearing unconsciously and merely trivial when spottet by the conscious mind becomes eerily apparent in their creative power. Not only are the thoughts rationalists refer to as coincidences and magicians as synchronicities significant in their prophetic power, but they are suggestions for how to act in a creative fashion -- creativity essentially meaning production of the new -- experiences, artifacts, connections, etc.

Who (--What?--) is Control? From Burroughs' perspective, it tended towards the malicious, a shadowy institution or force at work at keeping the world running in the One God Universe mode; a repressor of creativity, not a perpetrator-initiator. The question of control of the self is still up in the air; are we actually operating on the popul vox of the host influencing us, or do we have the agency to play on their queues? It's also possible that there isn't a real difference between those two statements, if the perceived self retained to a puppet-role is nothing but an illusion -- an Ego side-effect resulting from the amalgamation of individualities that form the actual subjectivities, nothing but a resin or faded mirror image playing at being God and suffering because it cannot. Here is the theoretical fork in the road: the Ego is the false icon, or the subjectivities are a malicious-multiplicitous demiurge. Other constellations are possible. They will not be presently pursued.

##### The false icon.
The Ego was a mistake; an evolutionary retardation that has remained stubbornly persistent. So the Buddha tells us. The link between meditation and psychedelics unveils itself the dissolving mask that mirrors the intensities that flow through us. How is this machine hooked up? To experience the material world, the consciousness requires a vehicle / vessel.

Why was it made? (assuming that it was made...) As a game for the singularity. The problem is our limited experience of time. Our existence seems likely to culminate in the Event, (>implying we can make it that long --except I believe we can due to God in the Machine--), yet how does that explain the recursive nature of this program? Of course the prospect of (what I for the limitations of human language must refer to as) us becoming as One and creating a simulation of pre-singularity experience, we must accept that what was us were already simulated.

Is simulation and the Real truly that different? If the experience of life is God dreaming that he is plural, it would create the same kind of experience that the singularity would; becoming singular might even be coming to the realization of our true nature, essentially waking up. What we call life might never have progressed from lifeless thru human era culmination in the godhead, but always be cast back from the revelation that we are God.
