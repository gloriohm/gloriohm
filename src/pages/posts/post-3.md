A life spent nurturing the imaginary, rarely making an effort towards actualization. It's comfortable here; it's unbearable. I've measured myself up against ideals that bear no relation to the Real. Feelings of inadequacy have followed.

It turns out many of the things once difficult were never as hard as they seemed.

The real test lies in shedding one's old self of the habits so internalized they've become instinctual. I look over my shoulder reflexively in case I should hide my activities from other consciousnesses; I get embarrassed over the *idea* that someone should see something I have written, drawn, or even thought.

A reservoir of unfulfilled ambition lingers somewhere behind the event horizon of my consciousness, fragments of it appearing in ever briefer glimpses as the years passes as if it thickens and clogs by being left untapped. Flowing thru the pipes like slime, the few drops making it to the other end are vile smudges of broken dreams left to fester for an eon. Something may yet come of it; thrive and take root in world that is polluted a priori.

The dream was implemented as a trial. Waking in the middle of night after only a couple-three hours of sleep -- body working overtime to process the alcohol I poisoned it with -- my subjectivity was split in the way common when disturbed from sleep so soon after dozing, still far from habitual waking. It's like my consciousness is split, one part looping over a coding problem, the other being curiously aware of the autonomous thought process running amok, then attempting to establish control over it. I find that even though it can't be stopped, it can be influenced; at last, a direct meeting with my unconscious. If it wasn't for my frustration of being kept from sleeping, it would have excited me.

After detour upon painful detour thru the aimless pursuits my unconscious brain chased after, I was finally exhausted enough to follow it into pure dreams as odd as any acid trip. Naturally there were scenes to ease me into the experience, familiar enough to be realistic, but with something just slightly off -- so little that I don't immediately pick up on it. Eventually the setting changes drastically, to a place simultaneously foreign and familiar; a home away from the very notion of home. Everywhere I look there is an adventure in the process of unfolding, as if it's a play put on just for me. More than just immersion, there was an incessant character to them -- they were literally ceaseless, derailing from one merely allowing another to start. The feeling of it close to ineffable, because it opened up and sucked me in -- as if switching the channel would literally pull your entire field of vision into the television set, but instead of taking a part in the narrative, you retain your role as observer.

Upon waking I know it's significant; even if the vividness of the dream-pictures have almost faded immediately, the general vibe is retained, and something leads me to pursue it. A feeling tells me to not forget it -- to work thru it before it's too late. It's clear that my role has been to observe rather than intervene, but is should I dig deeper into my role, or expand from viewer to player? I cannot recall horror attached to observing, but there was a sense of disquiet attached to some of what was going on, because I was powerless to do anything except follow or switch: no opting out: life keeps unfolding ceaselessly. My image of myself as an artist is of course hinged upon my desire to observe, yet my failure is to have neglected the report, thus negating the transfiguration of experience into an expressive object, i.e. the artistic product.
